Some weights of EsmModel were not initialized from the model checkpoint at /lustre/grp/gyqlab/liyh/esm/esm2_t33_650M_UR50D and are newly initialized: ['esm.pooler.dense.bias', 'esm.pooler.dense.weight']
You should probably TRAIN this model on a down-stream task to be able to use it for predictions and inference.
